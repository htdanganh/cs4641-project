The midterm report must be written on a website hosted with GitHub Pages. There is no word limitation for this deliverable. Reuse your proposal and make necessary updates and/or additions.

# Introduction
Accurate house pricing is crucial in the real estate and mortgage industries, influenced by physical attributes and neighborhood characteristics. Research has explored various machine learning techniques for house price prediction, with a study titled "An Optimal House Price Prediction Algorithm: XGBoost" comparing algorithms such as XGBoost, Support Vector Regressor, Random Forest Regressor, Multilayer Perceptron, and Multiple Linear Regression using the Ames City housing dataset. XGBoost was identified as the most effective model, offering interpretability, simplicity, and accuracy [3].

# Problem Definition
In Georgia's dynamic real estate market, accurately pricing a house is a nuanced challenge. Traditional valuation methods, such as comparative market analysis, often miss critical details and lack important context [2]. As a result, homes are frequently inaccurately appraised, and more accurate valuations can be costly in terms of both time and expenses. This project is motivated by the opportunity to overcome these limitations by leveraging machine learning models.

# Methods
Present at least one implemented solution including specific data processing method(s) and machine learning algorithm(s). Explain why your chosen model(s) and method(s) were selected.

# Results and Discussion
We had a high RMSE for linear regression. We suspect this is because the relationship between price and the features is nonlinear. We did try increasing the degrees of numerical features, but that helped only a little.

The following graph shows the results of linear and ridge regression, respectively.

The correlation matrix below reveals that there are a couple correlations among the features.

One next steps includes using a different model like XGBoost to handle nonlinear features. First cluster the data using K-means and then apply a regression like Neural Networks or XGBoost.
